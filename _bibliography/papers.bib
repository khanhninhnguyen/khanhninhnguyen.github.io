    abstract ={The detection and correction of non-natural inhomogeneities in long climatic records has gained a lot of interest in recent years. Several studies recommended detecting inhomogeneities in the series of the difference between a candidate series and a reference series and often assumed that the reference series is homogenous. When the latter assumption cannot be verified, a post-processing step is needed to determine the origin of the detected breakpoints. This study presents a so-called attribution method, which aims to determine the origin of the breakpoints detected in the series of IWV differences between GPS data and ERA5 reanalysis with the GNSSseg segmentation method [1]. We found that about 36.5% of change points can be validated from the GPS metadata, and the origins of the remaining 64.5% are questionable [2]. The ambiguity can be leveraged when there is at least one nearby GPS station with respect to which the candidate series can be compared. The proposed method uses significance tests combining the candidate GPS and ERA series and their homologues (denoted GPS' and ERA') from each nearby station. For each quadruplet (GPS, ERA, GPS', ERA'), six t-tests are performed, and the outcomes are combined. If sufficient consistency emerges for all the nearby stations, a decision can be made whether the breakpoint detected in the candidate GPS-ERA series is due to GPS or, alternatively, to ERA. Preliminary, at most 70% of change points have such consistent combinations, of which 52% is attributed to GPS. A predictive rule is trained on the simulated data using clustering methods to deal with the case of inconsistent combination, which can be due to the representativeness error in the GPS-ERA difference or uncertainties from the significance test. After the attribution step, the GPS and ERA series are corrected for their respective breakpoints, and IWV trends from both data sets are estimated.},

ABSTRACT = {This study investigates the sensitivity of the GNSSseg segmentation method to change in: GNSS data processing method, length of time series (17 to 25 years), auxiliary data used in the integrated water vapor (IWV) conversion, and reference time series used in the segmentation (ERA-Interim versus ERA5). Two GNSS data sets (IGS repro1 and CODE REPRO2015), representative of the first and second IGS reprocessing, were compared. Significant differences were found in the number and positions of detected change-points due to different a priori ZHD models, antenna/radome calibrations, and mapping functions. The more recent models used in the CODE solution have reduced noise and allow the segmentation to detect smaller offsets. Similarly, the more recent reanalysis ERA5 has reduced representativeness errors, improved quality compared to ERA-Interim, and achieves higher sensitivity of the segmentation. Only 45–50% of the detected change-points are similar between the two GNSS data sets or between the two reanalyses, compared to 70–80% when the length of the time series or the auxiliary data are changed. About 35% of the change-points are validated with respect to metadata. The uncertainty in the homogenized trends is estimated to be around 0.01–0.02 kg m−2 year−1.},
